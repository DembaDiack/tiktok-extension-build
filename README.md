Tiktok Autoplayer
</h1>
<p align="center">
<sup> 
    A tiny extension made by me to keep tiktok playing forever and ever :grinning:
</sup>
</p>

## Whats this about ?
i dont know about you, but sometimes i just wanna grab some popcorn :popcorn: , layback and let tiktok do its thing, now if theres no autoplay , no way can i do that can i ?

## Installation ? 

### 1.Download the repo :package:
to start you will need to download this repository as a zip file by clicking on "code" then "download as zip"

### 2.Go to your extension settings
youl need to visit your extension settings page on chrome, just click right on those three dots then :point_right: more tools :point_right: extensions

### 3.enable developper mode 
theres a switch on the right that says developper mode, switch that switch up! :metal:

### 4.click load unpacked 
you heard it, your gonna first extract that zip file though, then simply browse to the root of the folder and then tada! the extension is loaded.

## not clear ? 
i get it i suck at explaining, but theres plenty of articles that explain this process like this one
