## Whats this about ?
i dont know about you, but sometimes i just wanna grab some popcorn, layback and let tiktok do its thing, now if theres no autoplay , no way can i do that can i ?

## Installation ? 

### Download the repo :package:
to start you will need to download this repository as a zip file by clicking on "code" then "download as zip"

### Go to your extension settings
youl need to visit your extension settings page on chrome, just click right on those three dots then :point_right: more tools :point_right: extensions

### enable developper mode 
theres a switch on the right that says developper mode, switch that switch up! :metal:

### click load unpacked 
you heard it, your gonna first extract that zip file though, then simply browse to the root of the folder and then tada! the extension is loaded.
